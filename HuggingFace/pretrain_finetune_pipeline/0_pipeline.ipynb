For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you donâ€™t have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. Youâ€™ve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels â€” but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like.\n",
